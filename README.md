This README file is for the Multi-modal Communication of Robot Learning senior design project at Virginia Tech.

The current learning model is naive and does not learn over time, but chooses between a couple of targets as you move the robot towards them. As the user, your goal is to get to your intended target quickly and accurately.

The functionality that needs to be added includes:
* ~~Robot assistance and take over (Teleop.py)~~ *Needs to be Improved*
* ~~Compile a text file with the goal locations and their associated belief (Teleop.py)~~
* ~~Set up web server for Hololens to Access (Teleop.py and Server.py)~~
* Find places to call Haptic Functions from haptic_util.py (Teleop.py)
