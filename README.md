This README file is for the Multi-modal Communication of Robot Learning senior design project at Virginia Tech.

The current learning model is naive and does not learn over time, but chooses between a couple of targets as you move the robot towards them. As the user, your goal is to get to your intended target quickly and accurately.

The functionality that needs to be added includes:
* ~~Robot assistance and take over (Teleop.py)~~
* ~~Compile a text file with the goal locations and their associated belief (Teleop.py)~~
* ~~Set up web server for Hololens to Access (Teleop.py and Server.py)~~
* ~~Set up goal locations~~
* ~~Get color gradient working~~
* Find places to call Haptic Functions from haptic_util.py (Teleop.py)

To connect to the haptic device, the procedure is as follows:
1. x
2. y
3. z
